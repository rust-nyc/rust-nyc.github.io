### Rust NYC curated exercises

#### File exercise!

Download this file: [big.txt](http://norvig.com/big.txt)

1. Calculate number of bytes in file
2. Number of occurrences of the letter 'z' in file
3. Number of occurrences of all letters (case insensitive) in file

How does performance compare to this Python script version?

```python
file_ = open("big.txt")
count = 0
for line in file_:
    for char in line:
        count += 1
print(count)
```
